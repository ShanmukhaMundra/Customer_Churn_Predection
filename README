**Project Implementation**
(i). Importing necessary Libraries
(ii). Loading Dataset
      (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html)
(iii). Data Preprocessing
       (a). Handling Missing Values
       (b). Convert Integer value to Float
       (c). Categorical variable in Churn column need to be converted to numerical value
(iv). Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
      (a). Check Class Balance: Determine whether the dataset is balanced or imbalanced. For example:
              i. Balanced: Nearly equal counts of 0 and 1.
              ii. Imbalanced: One category significantly outnumbers the other.
       (c). Prepare for Modeling: If the dataset is imbalanced, we need techniques like class weighting in the model.
(v). Model Training we will use Random Forest
(vi). Model Training with other Machine Learning Models for comparison
      (a). Used Logistic Regression for comparison
(vii). Performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
